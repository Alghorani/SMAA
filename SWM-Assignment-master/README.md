Hello player!
This file contains information and instructions that will help you understand how DiamondHunter works :)
We hope you have an amazing experience!

Diamond Hunter is an adventerous 2d game where the character is required to go through a maze and collect all 15 diamonds in the least possible time.
The player will face some obstacles on their way, and will need to use tools that will be acquired while adventuring to get past them. 


A jar file named Diamond hunter should be on your screen. Once you open it, A menu will appear. You'll be given the choice of editing the map or skipping.
Once you make your choice being editing the map, you get to decide where you want to place the boat and the axe that you'll require to move aorund the map without getting stuck.

Good luck!!
